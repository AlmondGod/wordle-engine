To create your Wordle game, just copy and paste your list of words into wordlewords.txt, 
simply formatted one word per line, and now you have your equivalently-themed Wordle. 
Makes sure the list you input only 
consists of five-letter words. 

To run, simply download the code and run "Game". 

I've created AnimeWordle as a sample, with all anime-themed words.

GameBoard is the GUI, RunWordle is the large scale build of the wordle game,
wordle is the model behind everything.
