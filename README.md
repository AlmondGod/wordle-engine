## Wordle Engine

### Download Instructions
Requires Java 8

`git clone https://github.com/AlmondGod/wordle-engine.git`

### Building your Wordle
To create your Wordle game, just copy and paste your list of words into wordlewords.txt, 
simply formatted one word per line, and now you have your equivalently-themed Wordle. 
Makes sure the list you input only consists of five-letter words. 

### Example
I've created `AnimeWordle` as a sample, with all anime-themed words.

### Running your Wordle
run `Game` to get started. 

### System
`GameBoard` is the GUI, `RunWordle` is the large-scale build of the wordle game,
`wordle` is the model behind everything.
